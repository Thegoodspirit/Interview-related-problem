# Interview-related-problem
There are some interview related problem in python  so lets check out some question :-

# ANAGREM

Q1. WAP to print the anagram of a stings ?

NOTE:- 

ANAGREAM :- A good example problem for showing algorithms with different orders of magnitude is the classic anagram detection problem for strings. One string is an anagram of another if the second is simply a rearrangement of the first. For example, 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams. The strings 'python' and 'typhon' are anagrams as well. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the two strings in question are of equal length and that they are made up of symbols from the set of 26 lowercase alphabetic characters. 
Our goal is to write a boolean function that will take two strings and return whether they are anagrams.

# ARRAY FIND MISSING ELEMENT

Q2. consider  an array of non-negative. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input , the first is shuffled and the number 5 in removed to  construct the second array 

Input:

    finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])

Output:

    The missing element is := 5

# LARGEST CONTINUOUS SUM IN ARRAY

Q3. Give an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum.

Input:

    1,2,-1,3,4,10,10,-10,-1
    
Output:

    29
